Rusty Humblebee represents the endangered rusty bumblebee.

The image is from Ontario.ca because it was the most beautiful. 

hivehelper is a repository that reflects upon the conversion of raw data into usable structures and nutritious information!

While data storage and processing has taken on some pretty interesting water metaphors like streaming and data lake, at DDI we see information as somthing to be consumed.  

As we explore data we are thinking about 
  1 - identifying the most useful data sources, 
  2 - knowing where those data sources are located, 
  3 - understanding the best time to gather data from each source, 
  4 - considering how data is transported,
  5 - providing a useful storage cofiguration for the gathered data, 
  6 - retrieving stored data for use as information
  7 - assuring the quality of the information.

hivehelper is not concerned with specific technologies, since they all flutter in the winds of change.

hivehelper is concerned with professional reasoning, open standards and frameworks which transforms raw data into useful information.
